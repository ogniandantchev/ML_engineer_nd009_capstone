## 7. Project Design


a. Data import and exploration;  Data cleaning and pre-processing;  Feature engineering and data transformation;  Save the clean data in compact new format for use in other notebooks and upload to AWS bucket. 

b. Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets;  Define and train a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) RNN Model.

c. Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets; Define and train a Dilated Causal CNN Model.

d. Split the data into training, validation, and testing sets; Define and train a model from  Gluon Time Series (GluonTS) toolkit by Amazon Science

e. Evaluate and compare the models.

f. Deploy one of the models to AWS

The project's domain background — the field of research where the project is derived;
A problem statement — a problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined;
The datasets and inputs — data or inputs being used for the problem;
A solution statement — the solution proposed for the problem given;
A benchmark model — some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solution to;
A set of evaluation metrics — functional representations for how the solution can be measured;
An outline of the project design — how the solution will be developed and results obtained.
